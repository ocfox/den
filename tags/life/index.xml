      <description>&lt;p&gt;Excessive worry about the future drops me into a cycle of anxiety.
When I moved to the next station, these emotions stuck in my feet like a quagmire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-worry&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Worry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no need to worry about what you will fucked up.
Even if it happens, look forward, nothing will change if you pay for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forest, where I am. I want to follow pure instinct like a tiger, a dog, or even an ant.
Eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, enjoying music, enjoying the fresh air, paying attention to things around self.
Anyway, don&amp;rsquo;t tie up hands by life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Waste time cure my life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Music like time travel takes me into the past or future,
waste too.
What is waste? It&amp;rsquo;s some blurred concept.
Maybe I want to get something but I don&amp;rsquo;t work for that,
is this a kind of waste?
Gradually, I compromise â€” compromise to life, to what I need,
to what I want, and to everything I think in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I only follow what I could get instead of what I want to.
What&amp;rsquo;s the meaning of my thinking? Is this a kind of waste? Sometimes,
I remind myself that I can&amp;rsquo;t waste too much time, it will kill my life.
After these things, I enjoy wasting time, I call that enjoy the time, and enjoy life, if something I did and get happy, why not?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
